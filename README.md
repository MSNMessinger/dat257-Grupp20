# Date-IT Android app
An android application with all the information you need on the fair and all companies attending the fair. Also with the ability to save notes and add companies to a list of favourites.  

## Getting Started

### Apk download link: https://github.com/MSNMessinger/dat257-Grupp20/raw/master/DateIt.apk

HOW TO RUN APK INSTRUCTIONS
1) To run the app on your android phone just download the apk file from the link above. 
2) You might have to enable installation of apps from third party in your phones app settings. In that case. Go to settings--> apps--> choose the app that you will use for downloading the apk. ex: google chrome. --> look for option in the advanced tab that says: "Install apps from external sources" and enable it.
3) When download is finished you will get prompted by an option to install, click on install. If not, go to the file explorer and click on the downloaded apk file.
4) During the installation process you will probably get a couple of warnings regarding installing an app from a unknown source /developer. Just ignore these and continue with the installation. (Your phone will "probably" not get possessed by an evil spirit, but you never know :/)
