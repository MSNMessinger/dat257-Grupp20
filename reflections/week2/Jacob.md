## what do I want to learn or understand better?

I want to learn more about how to develop an app and to work in an agile project. This is because I have yet to program an app
and only have limited experiences using agile project structures. I will do my best to research and watch youtube videos of tutorials
on app development, and by listening to the lectures and working in an agile group I hope to learn more about agile project structures.

## how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

Like I stated before I have some experience in agile software projects, albeit small, I will do my best to help my group with scrum procedures such
as user stories. I will also try to help out the team in version-handling in github as this is something I've used in previous courses.

Since none of the group members are experienced in app development I will conduct research, and watch tutorials in order to help
the group with questions surrounding programming and app development. 

## what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

I have some previous knowledge and experience in scrum and this week we have focused on project scope and mockup. Since these are 
not explicitly part of scrum we have yet to start the actual planning of the backlog and user stories for example.

I will keep trying to better my understanding of scrum and agile project managament and this will in turn help the group to better
fulfill our goals for the project.


## what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

This week I have helped form the project scope and to create mockups for our app. We had some problems deciding on what app to choose 
since finding an external stakeholder proved more difficult than we anticipated. I have been active in our meetings and discussions
and tried to come up with constructive ideas and feedback to internal discussions.
