## what do I want to learn or understand better?

I still feel theres a need to better formulate User Stories in a way that makes them proper in size. A couple of weeks they were way to large, and in later sprints they were way to small.
To find a middle ground will help estimations on how much we would be able to accomplish during a sprint and also make sure that the work-load would be more evenly distributed. This is something I feel can 
be achieved by experience, writing and executing lots of User Stories will make us write better sized User Stories in future projects.

## how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

This week I was able to put the skills I have acquired during these sprints to the test as there was a problem another programming-pair had encountered regarding the layout on 
one of the pages. I was able to quickly help them solve the task and explain what the issue was and how to solve it.

As this is the last sprint I have to acknowledge that there's still a LOT of unexplored territory in Android app development we haven't touched on, but I can safely say 
that I know a lot more now than I did at the beggining of this project, both regarding agile processes and Android Studio/Android app development. If we were to do this project again
I would be able to help the team in ways I previously had none to very little experience in.

## what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

Just like all other weeks I've worked on planning the sprint together with the group, creating User Stories and Tasks. I was also co-product owner and 
was involved with the meeting with the product owner. I was also part of coding together with my pair-programming partner Oscar. I also helped reflect on the week
and write a team-reflection.

## what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

This week I worked in a coding pair with Oscar. We wanted to implement the ability to dynamically show and hide the favourite/notes list in the "My Page".
From the beggining we didn't really know if this is even possible in Android Studio as it seemed a bit to "Javascripty". So after researching it a bit we figured we could solve the problem in a different manner since
(as we expected) there is no inherent way of doing this in Android Studios. We settled on a solution with a toggle button in combinations with a visibility method that all listViews have inherent. The solution works well and 
even though there's no awesome effect that slowly drops the list or whatever, it still gets the job done.

After finishing the tasks we were handed I still felt I had the time and capability of fixing some of the other tasks that were still to be implemented. Usually I wouldn't do this since picking new User Stories
outside of the sprint-planning meeting was something we discouraged in the group. But since this was the last sprint and we have presentation to the stakeholder and teachers I wanted the app to be as good as it could be.
This was also something we talked briefly about in the Sprint Planning meeting, that if anyone had the time outside of their tasks to fix other functionality, this would be okay for this sprint.

With this in mind I also fixed the three buttons on the "home-page". One that opens up ArmIT's Facebook page on click, one that opens up Google Maps and starts a navigation to the fair's adress
as well as one that creates a new mail with ArmIT's mail adress filled in the "receiver" box.
