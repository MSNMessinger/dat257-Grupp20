## what do I want to learn or understand better?

As we still find it difficult to find edge-cases and test for bugs and such I would like to become better at unit-testing to make sure our App is optimized and stable.

## how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I have gathered quite a bit of knowledge on Android specific behaviour and problems during these weeks of the project. I feel I could help my group members if
they run in to such problems.

## what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

Just like all other weeks I've worked on planning the sprint together with the group, creating User Stories and Tasks. I was also co-product owner and 
was involved with the meeting with the product owner. I was also part of coding together with my pair-programming partner Rebecka. I also helped reflect on the week
and write a team-reflection.

## what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

This week I worked in a coding pair with Rebecka, implementing backend functionality which interacts with the fronted so that you are able to press a company from a list
and then be redirected to that company's detailed page. This was quite a challenge and I spent a lot of time coming up with a solution. I'm very happy with the result
and the fact that I didn't give up even though in some cases we felt pretty stuck.
