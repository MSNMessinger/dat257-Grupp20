## what do I want to learn or understand better?

This week some of the teams ran into some problems with their user story. This was not something we could have planned for but would undoubtably 
occur at one point or another in this project. Since every failure is a possibility to learn something new, I would like to better understand the issue at hand
as well as how to solve it. To my understanding the problem involved Android Studios specific tasks, something I am keen on learning more of. By understanding the problem
and discuss solutions I aim to further expand my knowledge on how to build Android apps.

## how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

Not much has changed since last week. I still have some basic knowledge on Android Studios from different tutorials on the web and youtube and also previous experience in java and software development in general.
This is something I hope can help the team achieve its goals and eventually bring satisfaction to the customer.

## what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

This week I engaged in conversations regarding our use of KPI's, or to be more specific, one KPI regarding testing and unit-testing of code as a measure of performance.
I didn't find this KPI to bring much value to neither us or our perception of how the development and team is performing. Because of the fact that our app is mostly design driven
there are not a lot of code which we can unit-test. Instead, I suggested we use a KPI which measures the satisfaction and requirements of our stakeholder. We eventually settled on this idea,
since it will give us more of an indication if we are on the right track according to the stakeholder and customer.

I also worked in a coding pair with Norbert as we finished our assigned user story for the week, but more on this later.


## what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

This week I worked in a coding pair with Norbert, working on an assigned user story which the team together worked out. This meant that we implemented the "For Students"
page which could be located from the Home Screen if you scroll down. We faced some difficulties (mostly because we wanted to make functionality more difficult than it had to be) but in the end the page
turned out really well and I am happy with the result.

I have also been a part of the weekly meeting with the stakeholder, as well as being a part of the reflection meeting, as well as planning for the next sprint, writing User Stories and tasks for next week.
