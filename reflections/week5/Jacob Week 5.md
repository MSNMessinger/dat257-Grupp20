## what do I want to learn or understand better?

As we ran into some problems with finalizing user stories last week we spent some more time this week in actually planning the sprint. Eventhough we did this my team (me and Linnea) did
not manage to finishing all of our tasks as we ran into some problems. I would like to better understand Android Studios as to not be forced into situations where I'm not able to solve a task.
This will for sure take some time but I keep on trying to improve through experience and following and watching guides from the internet and speaking with my team to try and get help or a better understanding of the problem.


## how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

As we have finished our definition of done this week we have concluded that javaDoc and unti-testing will have to play a bigger part in our project
than we have currently implementented. As this is something I have previous experience in from courses I have taken this is something I feel comfortable in and will be able to help my team.

## what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

This week I was scrum master together with Norbert, which meant leading the weekly meeting we have in order to improve the team's use of scrum.
For example we have spent a lot of time contemplating and discussing how we most effieciently should structure our sprint with user stories and tasks so we can be more productive.
Introduced a new KPI which will give us pointers as to what the stakeholder thinks about the current situation of the app. 


## what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

This week I worked in a coding pair with Linnea, implementing methods to be able to add and save notes as well as to add companies to the favourite list and also creating lists for companies with notes and companies who is favorite-marked
which will be used in the "My Page". One of the tasks included the possibility to save notes, which we interpreted in being able to save until next time the app is booted. This meant that we would have to save the data in a .json file, but we did not manage
to create such a method as we couldn't locate the file path in order to write information to it.

I was also Scrum Master together with Norbert, and we lead all the weekly meetings with the team including: Planning of the sprint, weekly stand-up meeting, meeting with stakeholder and team reflection meeting at the end of the sprint.
