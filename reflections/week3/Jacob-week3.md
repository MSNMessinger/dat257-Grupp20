## what do I want to learn or understand better?

I would like to learn more about different features and implementations in Android Studios which will be helpful in creating our Android app.
I also want to further my understanding of agile processes and continue to have meaningful and giving discussions together with my group and coding partners to come.


## how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I have spent some time watching Android Studios tutorials and reading up on some articles I found useful and with this knowledge I will be able to 
help the team with Android Studios related problems and help them come up with a fix or how to go about the problem.

## what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

This week was the first week of working in a Sprint. I worked in a programming pair with Cecilia and together we worked on a user story in implementing
the Company Details page. I have also been active in our team meetings with the stakeholder, our stand up meeting, various discussions and our team reflection.
I feel very much involved in the group's progress both in and outside of writing code.

I will keep trying to improve both myself and the group in working agile and bringing a positive vibe to our meetings and discussions. For me it is really important
that all of the members feel included and that everyone feel like they can get their voices heard and ideas met with a positive attitude.


## what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

This week, as previously mentioned, I worked in a coding pair with Cecilia finishing the assigned User Story. We didn't really have our KPI:s in place
whilst assigning the US but in hindsight the US was well in the range of what we were able to produce in the given timeframe. We faced some problems, but we
were able to work together to come up with solutions for obstacles we faced. 

I have also been a part of the weekly meeting with the stakeholder, and discussed some feedback she had for us, which turned out to be valuable for us as we decided to go
another route with some of the things she mentioned which we hadn't thought about. 

I was also a part of the reflection meeting, as well as planning for the next sprint, writing User Stories and tasks for next week.
